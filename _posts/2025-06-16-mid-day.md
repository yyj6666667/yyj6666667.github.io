no.1   currently working on:
	to slightly change the word in my blog
	some previous is a little exaggerating

no.1*	based on the script, using the service of 
	v6.51.la to build a function to record the
	visiting numbers

no.2 	accomplish my 夙愿：
	a lot of classic sorting algorithm is not 
	totally understund or completely accomplished
	
	for this project
	we requries:
		no.2.1:
		generic testbench for all
		algo one by one
		py or cpp version is both acceptable
no.3   solve the vpn transfer problem
	and it has potential to be a public one
	because we can build some bash scripts 
	or even more
